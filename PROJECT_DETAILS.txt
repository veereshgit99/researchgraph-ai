                           KEY FEATURES & FLOW
================================================================================

1. DASHBOARD (Home Page)
   - Grid view of all papers
   - Paper tiles show: title, authors (first 6), keywords (first 3), abstract
   - Click paper to open detail modal
   - Search functionality
   - Filters by category, author, date range

2. PAPER DETAIL MODAL
   - Full paper information
   - Authors list
   - Abstract
   - HuggingFace AI summary (if available)
   - Keywords (from HuggingFace or graph)
   - Graph concepts and methods
   - ArXiv link
   - "View in Graph" button

3. GRAPH VISUALIZATION
   - Interactive Neo4j graph display
   - Nodes: Papers, Authors, Concepts, Methods, Datasets, Metrics
   - Node sizing by importance (paper count)
   - Color-coded by node type
   - Hover tooltips (Paper nodes show year, ArXiv ID, categories)
   - Dynamic sidebar filters for each node type
   - Radial cluster layout algorithm
   - Click nodes to highlight connections
   - Edge labels showing relationship types

4. AI ASSISTANT
   - Chat interface similar to ChatGPT
   - User message: white background with "V" avatar
   - Assistant message: white background with sparkle icon
   - Real-time message streaming
   - Source citations displayed as badges
     - Papers (with ArXiv IDs)
     - Concepts (related research concepts)
     - Methods (techniques discussed)
   - Conversation history (last 10 messages for context)
   - Suggested questions for new users
   - Loading indicator while processing

5. SMART QUERY EXTRACTION
   - Uses OpenAI to understand user intent
   - Extracts relevant research terms from questions
   - Examples:
     "Explain transformers" → ["Transformer", "attention mechanism"]
     "What papers discuss BERT?" → ["BERT", "language model"]
     "Can I ask about sports?" → [] (no research terms)
   - Falls back to pattern matching if extraction fails
   - Only searches database for research-related queries

6. CONTEXT-AWARE RESPONSES
   - Queries Neo4j for relevant papers, concepts, methods
   - Sends context to OpenAI along with user question
   - Response cites papers from knowledge graph
   - Maintains conversation history for follow-up questions
   - Acknowledges database limitations when no papers match

================================================================================
                            HOW IT WORKS
================================================================================

USER FLOW - ASKING A QUESTION:

1. User types question in Assistant chat
   Example: "Explain the Transformer architecture"

2. Frontend sends to backend:
   POST /api/v1/assistant/chat
   {
     "message": "Explain the Transformer architecture",
     "conversation_history": [previous messages]
   }

3. Backend processes:
   a) Extract search terms using GPT-3.5-turbo
      → ["Transformer", "architecture", "mechanism"]
   
   b) Query Neo4j for each term:
      - Search papers by title/abstract
      - Get related concepts and methods
      - Get author information
      
   c) Format context as markdown:
      ## Relevant Papers:
      1. **Attention Is All You Need**
         - Authors: Vaswani et al.
         - ArXiv ID: 1706.03762
         - Concepts: Attention, Self-Attention, Multi-Head Attention
         
   d) Build OpenAI request:
      System: [AI personality and capabilities]
      User: [Context] + [User Question]
      
   e) Get response from GPT-5-nano
   
   f) Format and return response with sources

4. Frontend displays:
   - Response text
   - Source badges (papers, concepts, methods)
   - Maintains message history
